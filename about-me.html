        <h2>Hi there,</h2>
        <h3>My name is Nate Greene.</h3>
        <p>I am a graphic designer and illustrator living in Denver, Co. I am very passionate about art and dedicated to my craft! I enjoy working with all kinds of media, both digital and traditional. I would say my favorite part about graphic design is creating little characters and illustrations.</p>
        <p>I started drawing when I was a kid and never stopped. Over the years I have explored a wide variety of different artistic avenues and media. From traditional watercolor and oil painting to digital illustration and logo designs. I am always looking to broaden my horizons and explore new areas of creativity!</p>
        <p>Along my journey I studied drawing and painting at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design. About five years ago I moved to Colorado, in search of inspiration and a change of scene. And boy what a beautiful scene it is! Currently I am a student in Graphic Design at Front Range Community College, working to update my skills in digital media and complete my degree.</p>
